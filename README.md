# How to Play

Shuffle the 16 cards to form a face-down draw deck. 

	5x Guard 
	2x Priest 
	2x Baron 
	2x Handmaid
	2x Prince
	1x King
	1x Countess
	1x Princess

Remove the top card of the deck from the game without looking at it. If you are playing a two-player game, take three more cards from the top of the deck and place them to the side, face up. They will not be used during the first round. 

Love letter is played in a series of rounds. Each round represents one day. At the end of each round, one player’s letter reaches Princess Annette, and she reads it. When she reads enough letters from one suitor, she becomes enamored and grants that suitor permission to court her. That player wins the princess’s heart and the game.

Each player draws one card from the deck at the beginning of the game. This is the player’s hand, and is kept secret from the others. On your turn, draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand. Then choose one of the two cards in your hand and discard it face up in front of you. Apply any effect on the card you discarded. You must apply its effect even if it is bad for you. All discarded cards remain in front of the player who discarded them. Overlap the cards so that it’s clear in which order they were discarded. This helps players figure out which cards other players might be holding. Once you finish applying the card’s effect, the turn passes to the player on your left.

If a player is knocked out of the round, that player discards the card in his or her hand face up (do not apply the card’s effect) and takes no more turns until the next round. A round ends if the deck is empty at the end of a turn. The royal residence closes for the evening, the person closest to the princess delivers the love letter, and Princess Annette retires to her chambers to read it. 

All players still in the round reveal their hands. The player with the highest ranked card wins the round. In case of a tie, the player who discarded the highest total value of cards wins. A round also ends if all players but one are out of the round, in which case the remaining player wins.
